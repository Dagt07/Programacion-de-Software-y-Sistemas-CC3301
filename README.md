# Software and Systems Programming Course

## Course Overview

This course is designed to teach students how to efficiently program in C language, focusing on the optimal use of the hardware platform. Participants will not only learn advanced programming techniques in C but will also deeply explore the underlying hardware architecture and the operating system's application programming interface (API). This comprehensive approach will enable students to develop software that maximizes system performance.

## Platform Requirements

The official platform for testing assignments is Debian 11, which should be run under VirtualBox. It is also acceptable to use Debian 11 under WSL 2, VMware Player, or QEmu for the course exercises.

## Objectives

- Master advanced programming techniques in C.
- Understand the hardware architecture related to software performance.
- Utilize the operating system's APIs to enhance program functionality and efficiency.

This course is ideal for students who are looking to deepen their understanding of software development at a system level and want practical experience in optimizing software performance.
